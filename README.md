The columns <i>orderDate</i> and <i>Shipping Date</i> have a Text data type. To change the data type to Date format, follow these steps in Power BI Desktop:
<ol>
    <li>Go to the Table view.</li>
    <li>Select the column you want to change.</li>
    <li>From the Structure ribbon, select the Data type as Date.</li>
</ol>
This process ensures that date columns are correctly formatted for accurate analysis and reporting.
