    The columns <i>orderDate</i> and <i>Shipping Date</i> have a Text data type. To change the data type to Date format, follow these steps in Power BI Desktop:
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the Table view.</li>
        <li>Select the column you want to change.</li>
        <li>From the Structure ribbon, select the Data type as Date.</li>
    </ol>
    This process ensures that date columns are correctly formatted for accurate analysis and reporting.
The dashboard is strategically divided into two navigation panes tailored for key stakeholders: CSCO (Chief Supply Chain Officer) and CEO (Chief Executive Officer).
